this is a multi-section responsive landing page. the navigation menu was added dynamically depending on the number of sections. when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item  scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
for better user experience, the section actively being viewed  will change its background and the its item in the navigationbar too.
